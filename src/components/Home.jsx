      <p>I'll get straight to the point. I've made this website to connect with people,
        display some of my skills and for fun.

        On the folder tab you can find a list of my previous projects.

        On the Connect tab you can reach out to me, it will give you a list of my socials
        through a contact form.

        The music tab is just for fun, I change it every now and then.
      </p>
